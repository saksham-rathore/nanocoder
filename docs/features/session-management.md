# Session Management

Nanocoder automatically saves your conversations so you can close the terminal and pick up where you left off. Sessions are saved in the background — you don't need to do anything special.

## Resuming a Session

```bash
/resume         # browse recent sessions with an interactive selector
/resume last    # jump straight into the most recent session
/resume {id}    # resume a specific session by ID
/resume {n}     # resume by list index number
```

You can also use the aliases `/sessions` or `/history`.

### From the Command Line

You can resume a session directly at launch instead of using a slash command:

```bash
nanocoder --continue      # resume the most recent session for this directory (-c)
nanocoder --resume        # open the session picker at startup (-r)
nanocoder --resume last   # jump straight into the most recent session
nanocoder --resume {id}   # resume a specific session by ID or list index
```

`--continue` silently starts a fresh session if no previous session exists for the current directory, while `--resume` exits with an error if the requested session is not found. The two flags are mutually exclusive, and both are interactive-only — they cannot be combined with `run`. See the [CLI Options Reference](../getting-started/index.md#cli-options) for the full flag list.

## Renaming a Session

```bash
/rename <new name>    # rename the current session
```

The new name must be non-empty and **100 characters or less**. If the name exceeds this limit, an error message is displayed in chat.

## What Gets Saved

Each session captures:

- Full conversation history (all messages)
- Provider and model used
- Working directory
- Timestamps and message count
- Its artifacts: the implementation plan, the task list, and the completion walkthrough

Sessions are saved every 30 seconds by default and retained for 30 days.

## Storage Location

Sessions are stored in the platform-specific app data directory:

| Platform | Default Path |
|----------|-------------|
| macOS | `~/Library/Application Support/nanocoder/sessions/` |
| Linux | `~/.local/share/nanocoder/sessions/` |
| Windows | `%APPDATA%/nanocoder/sessions/` |

This can be overridden via the `directory` config option or `NANOCODER_DATA_DIR` environment variable.

### Session Artifacts

Alongside `sessions/`, each session gets an `artifacts/<session id>/` directory holding the files behind the **Plan**, **Tasks**, and **Walkthrough** shortcuts above the prompt. They are written with owner-only permissions and never placed in your project directory.

- Resuming a session restores its artifact shortcuts
- Deleting a session, or letting retention expire it, deletes its artifacts too
- Directories belonging to sessions that were never saved — because `autoSave` is off, or because `/clear` retired the session id — are swept at startup once they are more than a day old
- `nanocoder --plain` runs get a session for the duration of the run and delete their artifacts on exit, so headless runs leave nothing behind

See [Development Modes](development-modes.md) for how the artifacts are produced and [Task Management](task-management.md) for the task list specifically.

## Configuration

Customize session behaviour in your `nanocoder-preferences.json` (not `agents.config.json`):

```json
{
  "nanocoder": {
    "sessions": {
      "autoSave": true,
      "saveInterval": 30000,
      "maxSessions": 100,
      "maxMessages": 1000,
      "retentionDays": 30,
      "directory": ""
    }
  }
}
```

| Option | Default | Description |
|--------|---------|-------------|
| `autoSave` | `true` | Enable/disable automatic saving |
| `saveInterval` | `30000` | Milliseconds between saves (minimum 1000) |
| `maxSessions` | `100` | Maximum sessions to keep (minimum 1) |
| `maxMessages` | `1000` | Maximum messages sent to the model (context window capping) — on-disk history is NOT truncated (minimum 1) |
| `retentionDays` | `30` | Auto-delete sessions older than this (minimum 1) |
| `directory` | (platform default) | Custom storage directory |
