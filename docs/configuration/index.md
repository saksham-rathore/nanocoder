# Configuration

Nanocoder is configured through JSON files that control AI providers, MCP servers, user preferences, and more.

## JSON Schema (editors)

A JSON Schema for `agents.config.json` is published as `schemas/agents.config.schema.json`. It is generated deterministically from the on-disk config shape (see `scripts/generate-config-schema.ts`) and validated in CI to prevent drift.

To enable autocompletion and inline validation, add the `$schema` key at the top of your config:

```json
{
  "$schema": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Nano-Collective/nanocoder/main/schemas/agents.config.schema.json"
}
```

The schema only describes keys the loader actually reads from `agents.config.json`. Settings read from `nanocoder-preferences.json` (`notifications`, `sessions`, `paste`) are deliberately not advertised on this schema.

You can also wire it up without the `$schema` key:

- **VS Code**: add a `jsonValidation` rule for `**/agents.config.json` pointing at the schema file.
- **JetBrains IDEs**: under *Settings → Languages & Frameworks → Schemas and DTDs → JSON Schema Mappings*, add a mapping for `agents.config.json` to the schema file.
- **CLI validation** (any editor): `ajv validate -s schemas/agents.config.schema.json -d <your config>`.

## Configuration File Locations

Nanocoder looks for configuration in the following order (first found wins):

1. **Project-level** (highest priority): `agents.config.json` in your current working directory
   - Use this for project-specific providers, models, or API keys
   - Perfect for team sharing or repository-specific configurations

2. **User-level**: Platform-specific configuration directory
   - **macOS**: `~/Library/Preferences/nanocoder/agents.config.json`
   - **Linux/Unix**: `~/.config/nanocoder/agents.config.json` (respects `XDG_CONFIG_HOME`)
   - **Windows**: `%APPDATA%\nanocoder\agents.config.json`
   - Your global default configuration

> **Note:** When `NANOCODER_CONFIG_DIR` is set, it takes full precedence — the project-level and home directory checks are skipped, and Nanocoder looks for `agents.config.json` only in the specified directory.

> **Tip:** Use `/setup-config` to list all available configuration files and open any of them in your `$EDITOR`.

## Inspecting the Effective Configuration

When a setting is not behaving the way you expect, the hard question is not
what the value is but which file set it. `nanocoder config` answers both
without booting the interactive app.

```bash
nanocoder config list                                   # every resolved key and its layer
nanocoder config show nanocoder.autoCompact.threshold   # one key, in detail
nanocoder config show autoCompact                       # a whole block
nanocoder config diff                                   # only what your files change
nanocoder config diff --json                            # machine-readable output
```

`config list` prints the layers in play — built-in defaults, the global config
directory, the project directory, and `NANOCODER_*` environment variables —
along with whether each file is present, missing, or unreadable. A `*` beside a
key means a lower-precedence layer also sets it.

`config show <key>` adds the built-in default, the values that lost, and a line
explaining the rule that decided the winner. The key can be given in full
(`nanocoder.autoCompact.threshold`), without the `nanocoder.` prefix
(`autoCompact.threshold`), or as a block name to print every field under it.

`config diff` is the debugging view: everything your config files change
relative to the defaults, followed by every value that is set somewhere but is
not in effect, with the reason it lost.

> **Note:** Most settings are resolved **block by block**, not key by key. The
> highest-precedence file that defines a block — say `nanocoder.autoCompact` —
> supplies the whole block, and the fields it omits fall back to built-in
> defaults rather than to a lower-precedence file. A project file setting one
> field therefore discards the global file's other fields for that block.
> `config diff` lists exactly those discarded values.

API keys and other credentials are replaced with `<redacted>` in every output
format. An unsubstituted `${VAR}` reference is shown verbatim, since naming the
variable is the point of the output and the reference is not itself a secret.

## Environment Variables

Keep API keys out of version control using environment variables. Variables are loaded from shell environment (`.bashrc`, `.zshrc`) or `.env` file in your working directory.

### General

| Variable | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `NANOCODER_CONFIG_DIR` | Override the global configuration directory (skips all other config lookups) |
| `NANOCODER_CONTEXT_LIMIT` | Default context limit (tokens) used when no session override or provider context config applies and the model is not resolved from models.dev. Enables auto-compact and `/usage` to work correctly. Can also be set via the `--context-max` CLI flag (which takes priority) |
| `NANOCODER_DATA_DIR` | Override the application data directory for internal data like usage statistics |
| `NANOCODER_INSTALL_METHOD` | Override installation detection (`npm`, `homebrew`, `nix`, `unknown`) |
| `NANOCODER_DEFAULT_SHUTDOWN_TIMEOUT` | Graceful shutdown timeout in milliseconds (default: 5000) |
| `NANOCODER_MAX_TURNS` | Maximum LLM turns for headless runs (`--plain` and ACP). Overrides `nanocoder.headless.maxTurns`; default 200. See [Headless](#headless) |

### Provider & MCP Overrides

Override provider and MCP server configurations via environment variables. These take highest precedence over project-level and global config files.

| Variable | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `NANOCODER_PROVIDERS` | JSON string of provider configurations (overrides all config files) |
| `NANOCODER_PROVIDERS_FILE` | Path to a JSON file containing provider configurations (used if `NANOCODER_PROVIDERS` is not set) |
| `NANOCODER_MCPSERVERS` | JSON string of MCP server configurations (overrides all config files) |
| `NANOCODER_MCPSERVERS_FILE` | Path to a JSON file containing MCP server configurations (used if `NANOCODER_MCPSERVERS` is not set) |

See [Providers](providers/index.md) and [MCP Configuration](mcp-configuration.md) for format details and examples.

### Logging

These are covered in detail on the [Logging](logging.md) page.

| Variable | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `NANOCODER_LOG_LEVEL` | Log level: `trace`, `debug`, `info`, `warn`, `error`, `fatal` |
| `NANOCODER_LOG_TO_FILE` | Enable file logging (`true`/`false`) |
| `NANOCODER_LOG_DISABLE_FILE` | Disable file logging (`true` to disable) |
| `NANOCODER_LOG_DIR` | Override log directory |
| `NANOCODER_LOG_TRANSPORTS` | Configure logging transports (comma-separated) |
| `NANOCODER_CORRELATION_ENABLED` | Enable/disable correlation tracking (default: `true`) |
| `NANOCODER_CORRELATION_DEBUG` | Enable debug logging for correlation tracking |

### Environment Variable Substitution

You can reference environment variables in your configuration files using substitution syntax:

**Syntax:** `$VAR_NAME`, `${VAR_NAME}`, or `${VAR_NAME:-default}`

Substitution is applied recursively to all string fields in provider and MCP server configurations — any string value can reference environment variables, not just specific fields.

See `.env.example` for setup instructions.

## Context Limit Resolution Order

Nanocoder resolves a model's context limit in this order:

1. Session override from `/context-max` or `--context-max`
2. Provider `contextWindows[model]` in `agents.config.json`
3. Provider `contextWindow` in `agents.config.json`
4. `NANOCODER_CONTEXT_LIMIT`
5. models.dev metadata
6. Built-in Ollama fallback map

This lets you persist context limits for unknown or local models without reapplying `/context-max` every session.

## Application Settings

Beyond providers and MCP servers, `agents.config.json` supports application-level settings under the `nanocoder` key.

### Auto-Compact

Automatically compress context when it reaches a percentage of the model's context limit. See [Context Compression](../features/context-compression.md) for full details on how compression works.

```json
{
  "nanocoder": {
    "autoCompact": {
      "enabled": true,
      "threshold": 60,
      "strategy": "llm",
      "mode": "conservative",
      "notifyUser": true
    }
  }
}
```

| Option | Type | Default | Description |
|--------|------|---------|-------------|
| `enabled` | boolean | `true` | Enable/disable automatic compression |
| `threshold` | number | `60` | Context usage percentage to trigger compression (50–95) |
| `strategy` | string | `"llm"` | Compaction strategy: `"llm"` (model writes a structured summary) or `"mechanical"` (regex truncation) |
| `mode` | string | `"conservative"` | Mechanical compression mode: `"default"`, `"conservative"`, `"aggressive"` (ignored when strategy is `"llm"`) |
| `notifyUser` | boolean | `true` | Show a notification when auto-compact runs |

You can also override these per-session with `/compact --auto-on`, `/compact --auto-off`, `/compact --threshold <n>`, and `/compact --strategy llm|mechanical`.

### Sessions

Configure automatic session saving and retention. See [Session Management](../features/session-management.md) for usage details.

This setting is stored in `nanocoder-preferences.json` (see [Preferences](preferences.md) for file locations) — not in `agents.config.json`.

```json
{
  "nanocoder": {
    "sessions": {
      "autoSave": true,
      "saveInterval": 30000,
      "maxSessions": 100,
      "maxMessages": 1000,
      "retentionDays": 30,
      "directory": ""
    }
  }
}
```

| Option | Type | Default | Description |
|--------|------|---------|-------------|
| `autoSave` | boolean | `true` | Enable/disable automatic session saving |
| `saveInterval` | number | `30000` | Milliseconds between saves (minimum 1000) |
| `maxSessions` | number | `100` | Maximum sessions to keep (minimum 1) |
| `maxMessages` | number | `1000` | Maximum messages sent to the model in interactive/headless chat (minimum 1). Preserves on-disk history and system messages, capping only the context window. |
| `retentionDays` | number | `30` | Auto-delete sessions older than this (minimum 1) |
| `directory` | string | (platform default) | Custom storage directory for session files |

### Headless

Limits for non-interactive runs — the `--plain` shell (used in CI and non-TTY environments) and the ACP loop. There is no human to stop a wedged model in these runs, so the conversation loop caps the number of LLM turns.

When the cap is reached, the loop does **not** error out and discard work. On the final turn it strips all tools and asks the model to produce its answer using only the information it already has, so the run ends with a usable result.

```json
{
  "nanocoder": {
    "headless": {
      "maxTurns": 200
    }
  }
}
```

| Option | Type | Default | Description |
|--------|------|---------|-------------|
| `maxTurns` | number | `200` | Maximum LLM turns before the loop forces a final, tool-free answer (minimum 1). Raise it for long iterative jobs; the `NANOCODER_MAX_TURNS` env var takes precedence over this setting. |

One turn is a single LLM response plus its batch of tool executions. The default of 200 is high enough for long iterative jobs to finish while still bounding cost and wall-clock time for an unattended run that gets stuck.

### OS sandbox

File tools already refuse paths outside the project. `execute_bash` and `!command` did not: they spawn `sh` with your full user privileges. Set `nanocoder.sandbox` to `true` (boolean; a string like `"true"` is ignored and treated as off, with a warning) to wrap those two in an OS jail. Default is off.

```json
{
  "nanocoder": {
    "sandbox": true
  }
}
```

When on:

- **macOS** — `sandbox-exec` (deprecated by Apple, still present): no network; writes allowed in the project root, a per-command temp dir (`TMPDIR`), the Darwin user temp dir (bare `mktemp` ignores `TMPDIR`), and `/tmp` / `/private/tmp`. Reads are not restricted (`allow default`), so `cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa` still works and stdout still reaches the model.
- **Linux** — `bwrap` from `PATH` (bubblewrap): no network; `--ro-bind / /` plus a writable bind of the project and a per-command temp dir, plus `--tmpfs /tmp`. Same read caveat as macOS. If `bwrap` is missing, or present but cannot create a user namespace (`--unshare-net`), the tool returns an error and does **not** fall through to unsandboxed bash.
- **Windows** — not supported in this version. The tool returns an error if the flag is on.

This is not a secrets boundary. Network is blocked, writes outside the project and the jail temp dir are blocked, but the command can still read the rest of the filesystem and print it into the conversation.

Timeouts and cancel are unchanged. This does not sandbox custom tools or MCP.

### Retry Limits

Caps on how many times the conversation loop auto-retries a failing pattern without user intervention, so a stuck model cannot silently drain tokens. They apply in both runtimes: the interactive TUI loop and the `--plain` runtime used by `nanocoder run "..."` in CI and non-TTY environments (where they act within the [Headless](#headless) `maxTurns` ceiling). These are agent-loop limits — the per-provider `maxRetries` setting is unrelated and governs network request retries (see [Providers](providers/index.md)).

```json
{
  "nanocoder": {
    "retries": {
      "maxRepeatedToolCalls": 3,
      "maxEmptyTurns": 2,
      "maxMalformedRetries": 2
    }
  }
}
```

| Option | Type | Default | Description |
|--------|------|---------|-------------|
| `maxRepeatedToolCalls` | number | `3` | Pause threshold for consecutive identical tool calls (minimum 2). The check fires when the same call (or set of calls) is emitted for the Nth consecutive turn, before that call runs - so the default of 3 executes the repeated call twice and pauses on the third emission. In an interactive session you are asked whether to continue - useful when the repetition is legitimate, such as polling a long-running job - or stop. `--plain` and other non-interactive runs stop with a clear error. Calls to unknown tools count toward the streak too, so a model stuck on a nonexistent tool hits the same cap. |
| `maxEmptyTurns` | number | `2` | Consecutive empty assistant turns that are auto-nudged before giving up (minimum 0). The interactive loop additionally compacts the context and retries once before stopping; the `--plain` runtime stops directly after the nudges. |
| `maxMalformedRetries` | number | `2` | Malformed self-correction retries allowed for text-parsed tool calls before the loop gives up (minimum 0). Applies to the XML fallback path in both runtimes. The interactive loop also parses tool-call text from native-tool models that emit it instead of native calls, so the cap covers that case there; the `--plain` runtime only parses text on the XML fallback path. |

Choosing "Continue" at the repeated-tool-call prompt runs the paused call and re-checks after `maxRepeatedToolCalls` further identical calls, so a genuinely stuck model is re-prompted rather than left looping.

Setting `maxEmptyTurns` or `maxMalformedRetries` to `0` disables the nudge entirely, so the first empty or malformed turn ends the run - the fail-fast behaviour `--plain` had before these limits existed, worth setting when a silent or malformed-output model should cost one model call rather than three. The interactive loop still runs its single compact-and-retry after an empty turn even at `0`.

> **Warning - CI polling patterns:** in `--plain` runs (`nanocoder run "..."` in CI and non-TTY environments) there is no prompt to answer, so `maxRepeatedToolCalls` is a hard stop. A workflow whose model legitimately repeats the identical command - polling a deploy, re-running the same check while waiting on an external state change - aborts with exit code `1` once the cap is hit, by default on the third consecutive identical call. Raise `nanocoder.retries.maxRepeatedToolCalls` in that project's `agents.config.json` before relying on such a polling pattern.

Unlike [Headless](#headless), these limits do not cover the ACP loop (`--acp`, used by editor clients), which is bounded by `maxTurns` alone. Delegated [subagent](../features/subagents.md) runs apply `maxRepeatedToolCalls` - a stuck subagent stops with an error naming the setting, since there is nobody to ask inside a delegated run - but not the other two limits: a subagent's loop ends on its own after an empty turn, and it does not use text-parsed tool calls.

### Paste Handling

Configure how pasted text is handled in the input. By default, single-line pastes of 800 characters or fewer are inserted directly, while longer or multi-line pastes are collapsed into a `[Paste #N: X chars]` placeholder.

You can change the threshold interactively via `/settings` → **Paste Threshold**, or by editing `nanocoder-preferences.json` directly:

```json
{
  "nanocoder": {
    "paste": {
      "singleLineThreshold": 800
    }
  }
}
```

| Option | Type | Default | Description |
|--------|------|---------|-------------|
| `singleLineThreshold` | number | `800` | Maximum characters for a single-line paste to be inserted directly. Pastes longer than this (or multi-line pastes) become placeholders. Must be a positive integer. |

This setting is stored in `nanocoder-preferences.json` (see [Preferences](preferences.md) for file locations).

### Default Development Mode

Set the initial development mode for all new interactive sessions. Without this setting, Nanocoder always starts in **normal** mode. Once a session begins, you can still switch modes at any time using `/mode`.

```json
{
  "nanocoder": {
    "defaultMode": "plan"
  }
}
```

| Value | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `"normal"` | Standard mode — all tool calls require approval |
| `"auto-accept"` | Semi-automatic — read-only and safe tools auto-run; writes and bash prompts |
| `"yolo"` | Fully automatic — no confirmations at all |
| `"plan"` | Read-only exploration mode — only read/search/list tools available |

The `--mode` CLI flag always takes precedence over this config value. Non-interactive runs (`nanocoder run ...`) always default to `auto-accept` regardless of this setting.

### Tool Auto-Approval

Allow specific tools to run without confirmation, even in normal development mode. The `alwaysAllow` array accepts tool names — listed tools execute immediately without prompting for approval, and the same list also applies to non-interactive runs (`nanocoder run ...`).

```json
{
  "nanocoder": {
    "alwaysAllow": ["execute_bash", "read_file", "find_files"]
  }
}
```

### Disabling Tools

Turn off individual tools globally with the top-level `disabledTools` array. Listed tools are filtered out everywhere the model could ask for them — chat, [subagents](../features/subagents.md), and every [`/tune` profile](../features/tune.md). The model is told they don't exist, so it won't try to call them.

```json
{
  "nanocoder": {
    "disabledTools": ["execute_bash", "web_search"]
  }
}
```

Names match the registered tool ids (`read_file`, `write_file`, `string_replace`, `execute_bash`, `web_search`, `fetch_url`, `agent`, etc.). [MCP](mcp-configuration.md) tools follow the same naming as in their server config.

Resolution: project-level `agents.config.json` wins over the global config. The list is layered on top of `/tune` profiles and mode exclusions — if `nano` profile would otherwise expose `read_file`, listing it in `disabledTools` removes it. Subagents respect the global list even if their own `tools` allow-list includes the disabled name.

### Lifecycle Hooks

Run your own shell commands at fixed points in the agent loop — before/after a tool, on session start/end, on prompt submit, before compaction. Hooks cost no tokens and fire every time, and a `pre-tool-use` hook that exits non-zero denies the tool call.

```json
{
  "nanocoder": {
    "hooks": {
      "post-tool-use": [
        {
          "matchTools": ["write_file", "string_replace"],
          "command": "biome check --write \"$NANOCODER_FILE\""
        }
      ],
      "pre-tool-use": [
        {"name": "no-env", "command": ".nanocoder/hooks/guard.sh", "timeout": 5000}
      ],
      "session-start": [{"command": "git log --oneline -5"}]
    }
  }
}
```

Each entry takes `command` (required), plus optional `matchTools` (tool names the hook applies to; omitted means all), `timeout` (ms, default 30000, except `session-end` which defaults to 2000 to fit inside the shutdown budget), and `name` (label used in messages and `/doctor`). Context arrives as `NANOCODER_*` environment variables — `$VAR` references inside `command` are deliberately left unexpanded at load time so the shell sees them.

Hooks are project-local shell commands, so they carry the same code-execution weight as `mcpServers` in the same file and are gated by the same directory-trust prompt. See [Lifecycle Hooks](../features/hooks.md) for the full event list, environment contract, and blocking semantics.

### Custom System Prompt

Override or extend the built-in system prompt with your own. Useful when running small or context-constrained models where the default prompt consumes too many tokens, or when you want to specialize Nanocoder for a non-coding workflow.

The simplest form replaces the entire built-in prompt with inline content:

```json
{
  "nanocoder": {
    "systemPrompt": {
      "content": "You are an AI model running on CPU. Be concise."
    }
  }
}
```

Or load the prompt from a file (path is resolved relative to the working directory unless absolute):

```json
{
  "nanocoder": {
    "systemPrompt": {
      "mode": "replace",
      "file": "./.nanocoder/system-prompt.md"
    }
  }
}
```

Use `"mode": "append"` to keep the built-in prompt and add your text at the end:

```json
{
  "nanocoder": {
    "systemPrompt": {
      "mode": "append",
      "content": "Always respond in British English."
    }
  }
}
```

| Option | Type | Default | Description |
|--------|------|---------|-------------|
| `mode` | string | `"replace"` | `"replace"` overrides the built-in prompt entirely (no system info, no AGENTS.md). `"append"` adds your content after the built-in prompt. |
| `content` | string | — | Inline prompt text. Takes priority over `file` if both are set. |
| `file` | string | — | Path to a markdown/text file containing the prompt. Resolved relative to the working directory if not absolute. |

**Notes:**
- In `replace` mode, the built-in `## SYSTEM INFORMATION` section and AGENTS.md auto-append are skipped — include them yourself if you need them.
- Tool definitions are still injected into the prompt for providers that don't support native tool calling. Tool availability is controlled separately via `disabledTools` and `/tune`.
- If the file can't be read, Nanocoder logs a warning and falls back to the built-in prompt.
- Project-level `agents.config.json` wins over the global config.

### Web Search

The `web_search` tool uses the [Brave Search API](https://brave.com/search/api/) and requires an API key to enable. Without a key, the tool is not registered and won't be available to the model.

Brave's free tier includes 2,000 queries per month. [Get an API key here](https://brave.com/search/api/).

```json
{
  "nanocoder": {
    "nanocoderTools": {
      "webSearch": {
        "apiKey": "$BRAVE_SEARCH_API_KEY"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

The `apiKey` field supports environment variable substitution (`$VAR`, `${VAR}`, `${VAR:-default}`), so you can keep the actual key in your environment rather than in the config file.

## Ignoring Files

Nanocoder already respects your `.gitignore`, so `node_modules`, `dist` and friends stay out of the way. But some files are tracked in git and still not worth spending context on: lockfiles, generated fixtures, vendored bundles, big snapshot files.

Create a `.nanocoderignore` at your project root to exclude those too. It uses the same pattern syntax as `.gitignore`:

```
# Tracked, but not worth the tokens
package-lock.json
pnpm-lock.yaml
tests/__fixtures__/
docs/generated/
```

**What it affects:** the `list_directory`, `find_files` and `search_file_contents` tools, the `@` file autocomplete, and the interactive file explorer. Matching files stop showing up in listings and search results, which is what keeps them out of the model's context.

**What it does not affect:** `read_file` and `execute_bash`. If the model is given an exact path it can still read the file, and nothing stops a `cat` in a shell command.

> **Important:** `.nanocoderignore` is a context-hygiene tool, not a secrets boundary. Listing `.env` in it makes the file harder for the model to stumble across, but it does not prevent the file being read. Keep real secrets out of the workspace, or out of files the agent has any reason to open.

Patterns are applied after `.gitignore` and Nanocoder's built-in defaults, so a leading `!` can un-ignore something:

```
# Nanocoder ignores dist/ by default; opt back in for this project
!dist
```

Checkpoints deliberately skip `.nanocoderignore`. A file you hid from listings is still snapshotted, so restoring a checkpoint reverts it like anything else. See [Checkpointing](../features/checkpointing.md).
